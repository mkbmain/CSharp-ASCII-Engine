Free to do what you like with this is a muck around project

that was made for nostalgia reasons after finding a zx 80 computer


the idea was to allow people to create a game with just simple comands
and drawing the maps in text files i think it succeded in all fairness
few extra feature to implement like a load config maybe player life
and remove item id and also custom char values for map



would like to keep this format and build up in to simple graphics
then even in to rpg maker level thought i would start from bottom and 
work my way up though
