please note this is not finished

Free to do what you like with this is a muck around project

that was made for nostalgia reasons after finding a zx 80 computer


the idea was to allow people to create a game with just simple comands
and drawing the maps in text files i think it succeded in all fairness
few extra feature to implement like a load config maybe player life
and remove item id and also custom char values for map

would like to keep this format and build up in to simple graphics
then even in to rpg maker level thought i would start from bottom and 
work my way up though as well somthing to do since i have had to give up
alchol and smoking lol


todo allow custom char for built in objects will probably go with a 
'' on var part of a level e.g

please see Game.load and .tgl files

and remove this from the custom object serialize model


also need to add health attribute to player and make enemies or traps 
(custom oject with ability to -life) when steped on with out required item
can also instant death this way
